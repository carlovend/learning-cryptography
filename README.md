# learning-cryptography

Just a small personal project where I’m learning the basics of cryptography by doing different coding challenges.  
Nothing fancy — just experimenting, breaking stuff, and figuring things out as I go.

## 🧩 About
This repo is mostly a collection of small exercises and challenges related to cryptography.  
It’s all for learning purposes — to understand how things like encoding, XOR, and simple ciphers actually work under the hood.

---

## ⚙️ Goal
Learn by writing code.  
No frameworks, no shortcuts, just pure Python and curiosity.

---

## 📘 Note
This project isn’t meant for real-world cryptography or secure use.  
It’s just a personal sandbox to practice and explore.
